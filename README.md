## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repo connects our slides to academic theory and measurable ROI:
1. **Maps our slides to theory** (DSN, VRIO, outcome-based models).  
2. **Anchors slide claims to case evidence** (with page references).  
3. **Provides an interactive ROI sandbox** where you can test Security+ economics.
