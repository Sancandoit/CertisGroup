# Strategic challenges (VRIO + Go-to-Market lens)

- **Internal resistance and skills**  
  Workforce age and adoption hurdles; addressed via Corporate University and culture programs.

- **Capability gaps**  
  Orchestration + change engine are rare together; need to keep differentiating with analytics and SOP encoding.

- **Client integration complexity**  
  Multiple silo budgets; requires C-suite selling to aggregate value.

- **Market skepticism**  
  Industry seen as “low-tech”; must showcase applied AI and mission impact to attract talent and customers.
